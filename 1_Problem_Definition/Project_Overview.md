# Project Overview: Skin Cancer Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to detect and classify skin lesions into nine categories using deep learning techniques. Automated classification of skin lesions can assist dermatologists in early diagnosis, reduce misdiagnosis, and improve patient outcomes. The project focuses on **multiclass classification** of dermoscopic images.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following classes and number of images:

1. Actinic Keratosis – 130 images  
2. Basal Cell Carcinoma – 392 images  
3. Dermatofibroma – 111 images  
4. Melanoma – 454 images  
5. Nevus – 373 images  
6. Pigmented Benign Keratosis – 478 images  
7. Seborrheic Keratosis – 80 images  
8. Squamous Cell Carcinoma – 197 images  
9. Vascular Lesion – 142 images  

This distribution shows a **class imbalance**, which is a key challenge in model training.

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Problem Definition**
   - Define goals, objectives, and performance criteria for skin lesion classification.

2. **Data Acquisition & Understanding**
   - Use dermoscopic image datasets such as HAM10000.  
   - Analyze class distributions and image quality.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize sample counts and image statistics.  
   - Analyze patterns and feature differences across lesion types.

4. **Preprocessing**
   - Resize images, normalize pixel values, and apply data augmentation.  

5. **Modeling**
   - Use CNN architectures such as ResNet, EfficientNet, or VGG for multiclass classification.  
   - Experiment with transfer learning to handle small class sizes.

6. **Evaluation**
   - Assess models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and AUC.  
   - Address class imbalance using weighted loss functions or oversampling techniques.

7. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the best-performing model using **FastAPI**, providing a REST API for real-time predictions.  
   - Enable integration with web or mobile applications.

8. **Monitoring**
   - Track model performance over time and retrain when new labeled data is available.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Deployment:** FastAPI, Uvicorn  

## Success Criteria

- Achieve F1-score > 0.85 on the test set across all classes.  
- Real-time prediction latency under 1 second per image via API.  
- Balanced performance across all lesion types despite class imbalance.  
- Scalable REST API ready for clinical integration.
